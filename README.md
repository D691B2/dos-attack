Denial-of-service attack
In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks 
to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
this my first project in programming by language c++ - and by this program you can attacked on server of some website by { sending data } !

USING : you can use it when you have a zombies ;)
open program DOS-test.exe you will get page on CMD !
put the name of website you want to attacked without protocol (http:// -- https://) !
put the number of bytes you want to send it in (ms) !
put the number of seconds you want to open by it anouther cmd page !
put the number of windows you want to open it in your attack (look your using CPU) !

example :
www.example.com or (ip address) -> 192.168.1.150
5120 bytes -> 333ms
0.1 second
10 windows

#just this it's easy program and if you want to dev him you will have the source code DOS-test.cpp *good luck*
